        ## Basic modern app dev\n
        **layers**\n
        1. UI Layer\n
        2. Domain Layer\n
        3. Dat Layer\n
        \n
        ## App environment\n
        Every android app has its own Linux user id.
        The OS uses this user id to assign access permissions.
        If two apps have the same user id, they can share files.
        Every app can request the permission to use a specific system function, like GPS.\n

        ## Basic architecture of android\n
        **Four components**\n
        - Activity: is an activity\n
        - Service: non-visible function components of the app, e.g. download service\n
        - Broadcast: react to system broadcasts\n
        - Content Provider: access data\n
        \n
        **binding**
        A binding is basically something facilitates program expression.
        Data binding and view binding are two types of bindings in Android.\n
